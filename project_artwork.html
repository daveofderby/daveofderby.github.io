      <h2>My Artistic Creations</h2>
      <div>
        <p>I'm no artist, but I'd like to think I'm artistic. I would categorize myself a "copy and paste" creator. </p>
        <p>As a teenager I remember purposefully not taking Art GCSE (they were actually called O'Levels at the time). I could only choose two practical skills courses and Computing/IT was guarantied to be one of them. 
          I just couldn't see any practical future realistic employment skills in it...so I took CDT (Craft Design Technology - a fancy name for
          woodwork). Teenagers can be ! Anyway, I still loved to draw so ended up producing a number of
          pencil works that a friend submitted for his coursework... I think he got a 'B+'</p>

          <h2>My Banksy Copies</h2>
          <p>Banksy's work is has always resonated with me, especially in its duality and use of a natural canvases.
            It's simple and yet very thought provoking.</p>
          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
            <img src="project_artwork/banksy1.jpg" alt="Banksy Stencil" style="width:100%; padding-bottom: 1rem;">
          </div>
          <div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-8">
            <p>My new home has a large garden and some dated structures. A perfect place for my first Banksy copy I
              thought one dry winters day.
            </p>
            <p>So I dug out my stencil creator (a fantastic piece of kit to have by the way), found the best quality
              photo of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_Balloon">Girl with Balloon</a>" and created a
              stencil file. Unfortunately, if you like creating large pieces
              of art you have to be a little creative. As you can see there quite a few A4 sheets taped together to make
              the full image.</p>

          <div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-8">
            <p>Hey..that worked! (Ok I had to move the balloon closer and shorten the string, but I was happy with the
              result).
            </p>
            <p>I have seen a number of recreations of this piece of work, and most miss what I consider a key part. If
              you look at the unpainted parts of the girl you can see a skeletal figure (make sure you're looking at the
              original work). This in
              conjunction with the image of a young girl is something I've always interpreted as the beginning and end
              of life</p>

            <p>It's funny how unplanned coincidences can add to artwork. </p>
            <p>A few days later I was standing up at the top of my garden where there is a security light. Remember that
              tree in the first photo? Well it seems to be in perfect alignment to produce a new shadow/stencil image on
              dark winter evenings...Bonus!

            <p>One for indoors this time... </p>
            <p>About a year later both my sons were back living at home and now young men. Constantly telling them "do
              this, pick up that..." just doesn't seem to work so I wanted to get my message across with less effort.

            <p>Positioned at the bottom of the stairs, hopefully it will be seen daily as they still have to exit their
              bedrooms for uberEats deliveries. </p>

            <p>Here we go again. "Hmmm, that wall needs something... white-washing? No.. Something else."</p>
            <p>After spending two years changing a basic grass garden into a colourful landscape I created (and by that
              I mean copied) my latest Banksy.
            </p>
            <p>Troubles in Gaza/Israel had recently started up again and so the aptly "<a

          <div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-8">
            <p>So far so good, but there's a bit more colour needed in this one...</p>
            <p>Remembering that my son had a collection of Warhammer paints I dug out the more colourful ones.
              Fortunately, with the model figurines being small and war like, the bright colour pots still had plenty of
              content. </p>

            <p>Not being able to find a clear picture on the internet of the flowers I had nothing to copy from this
              time.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, I do have some skills and I think managed to do a good job. Perhaps that's enough Banksy's

          <p>Often when I need to plan or make decisions like "should I get a new job?" I find painting helps me. The
            feeling of surprise such as "Oh! I wasn't expecting that" also appeals. So back in 2007 I set about
            re-decorating our downstairs toilet.

          <p>The first image was inspired by Robert Indiana's sculpture "<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_(image)">Love</a>". Mixed in with my love of 1970s artwork,
            disco, and the Beatles.</p>
          <p>I'd like to think that guests to my home hopefully had an improved experience when visiting the loo. </p>

          <p>Be careful giving your children a choice of what they would like painted on their bedroom walls... The
            StarWars characters were quite simple, but when your other son chooses a picture from a book and says "The
            whole wall" it takes a little bit longer.

            wash off
            in the rain, but the grid pattern of slabs will help with copying pictures that look good when finished. All
            you have to do is draw a grid on top of a printed picture and then redraw the content of each grid square
            onto each slab. </p>

          <p>When my son's were young and at the age when they were starting to read, my current job meant that I often
            had to stay away a couple of nights a week. Often, in the evenings I would find myself in the hotel room
            watching some rubbish on TV.</p>
          <p>I decided that I would have a go at writing a book for them, after all I was quite good at making up
            stories whilst out on a walk. How hard can it be?</p>
          <p>It is not as easy as I thought. But I stuck at it and thanks to the developing internet companies at the
            time I managed to have it printed for them to read. </p>
