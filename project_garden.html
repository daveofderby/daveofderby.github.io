      <h2>Garden Canvas</h2>
      <p>In early 2022 we moved home that had a very big garden. The previous owners had developed it to a point,
        however, I could see there was a lot more potential.</p>
      <p>What started off as a tidying up project soon turned into an 800 day (just over 2 years) personal mission...
      </p>
      <p>The following gallery and blog is a summary of the sub-projects I undertook during that time. Furthermore,
        because we had spent all our savings to buy this new house (as you do) I had use what I found...</p>

          <p>Looking out the window the first morning in our new home I was pleased that moving day was over! Saving
            money we hired a van and called in as many helpers as possible. Unfortunately, on the very same day Russia
            decided to invade Ukraine and so there was a lot of distraction for the younger helpers. Never the less, we
            managed to get it all done by midnight.</p>
          <p>For the next few days boxes were being unpacked and a lot of items moved up to the large brick shed at the
            top of the garden (soon to be known as "Dave's Cave"). Later, on that cold February evening I lit a fire,
            drank a cold beer and pondered what to do with this larger than average garden...</p>

          <h2>Concrete and Crazy Paving</h2>
          <p>Without doubt, the largest sub-project of all was the path. It was the first one I started and almost the
            last to finish.</p>
          <p>March arrived and the home was becoming more habitable (i.e. less living out of boxes, and all Ikea beds
            had been reassembled). My attentions now turned to the garden. I remember it was late in the evening and I
            wanted to move a pile of builders sand off the grass and into bags (to be used for something later). As I
            cleared the last of the sand by torchlight, my spade hit something solid. On further investigation I had
            uncovered a series of slabs and for the next few days I'd revealed a path leading the whole length of the
            garden!</p>
          <p>But it didn't stop there, I kept on finding even more solid concrete, bricks, rocks and quite a few very
            heavy pavement edgings. I was at that point the theme tune to the "Wombles" popped into my head...especially
            the line "Making good use of the things that we find". So the pavement edging was used to border the grass
            for easy mowing, and the bricks and rocks used as foundation for the parts of the path that needed
            re-building.</p>
          <p>The other main decision I made was to make the path wide enough to drag a wheelie bin along and one slab
            just wasn't enough. I also had to raise the path as a ramp near the top patio so that it was "wheelchair
            friendly" for any future guests. </p>
          <p>Some slabs were re-purposed and I had to purchase about thirty second hand ones on ebay to finish the job
            (my first financial outlay). Fortunately there was a couple of bags of concrete left by the previous owners
            so I used that with the sand to rebuild the "crazy paving" sections.</p>

          <h2>"Here, have this Greenhouse"</h2>
          <p>Fortunately, in my new home I have good neighbors on both sides. Generous, friendly and happy to have a
            chat
            over the fence... During one of these chats I happened to mention that I wanted to eventually obtain a
            greenhouse..."You can have that one if you want" and thus began the transfer of an old and distorted
            aluminum greenhouse (with less than 50% glass) from one garden to another.</p>
            <p>First task, removed the existing rotten shed.  Then created a foundation.  Fortunately, I found more concrete sleepers and stacks of bricks behind the shed.</p>
            <p>Then came the first major problem.  The wall I was going to put the greenhouse against (to save finding glass for one side) was crumbling to bits.  All the loose bricks had to be removed and re-mortared back in place.  The wall went up about a metre and then stopped so I decided to build a shelf and use spare roof tiles to prevent further water damage.  However, that meant I would have to raise the height of the greenhouse by building a foundation wall so that it matched the top of the shelf. (Fortunately, this meant that you didn't have to duck when going in the shed.  It looked nicer too.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p>Finally, the greenhouse was complete...with missing glass panels taken from old double-glazed windows, bathroom panels used for the back, and bricks for the floor.  Yes, there was a lot of stuff left by the previous owners, probably from the extension built 10 years earlier.</p>
            <p> I then set about using the railway sleepers (also left by previous owners) to build a odd shaped raised bed next to it. Filled it with all the soil dug out from under the greenhouse and built a cover to stop my cats pooping in there.  The greenhouse then became my favorite place to have a break in (it was warm).</p>
