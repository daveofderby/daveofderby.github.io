      <p>From March 2022 to May 2024 I spent my free time developing my garden from a field to family paradise with a very small budget.</p>

            <p class="pagetext">You have to start somewhere, so why not create a path from one end of the garden to the other?<br>In hindsight, this turned out to be the largest project as most of the path needed to be dug up and relayed. </p>
